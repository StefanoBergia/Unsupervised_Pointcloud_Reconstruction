# Unsupervised Pointcloud Reconstruction
Point-Clouds are one of the most powerful and easiest methods to represent 3-D objects. They are unordered, unstructured and eager for precise manual annotation due to many possible sources of noise. For these reasons, classical CNNs cannot deal with raw Point-Clouds and they need some computationally expensive data pre-processing operations. In recent years, some deep learning methods started to deal with raw Point-Cloud data for classification and segmentation tasks with excellent results, like PointNet and DGCNN. The aim of this work is to implement a Point-Cloud Auto-Encoder able to encode the main features and reconstruct as precisely as possible the original input in a totally unsupervised way, basing on these previous works. We also studied how it can be used for solving a Point-Cloud completion task.
